# Spectral-GBSAR
Spectral estimation model for linear displacement and vibration monitoring with GBSAR system 

This repository demonstrates how to retrieve fast linear or vibrational displacemens from Ground-based SAR (GBSAR) signal, while maintaining high spatial resolution using spectral estimation.
## Usage
run "AzVel_RT.m" to simulate a scenario, where scatterers are moving in a linear pattern during the SAR imaging.
run "AzVel.m" to simulate a scenario, where scatterers are moving in a linear pattern while a fixed MIMO radar is collecting signal with a fixed rate.
run "AzVib_RT.m" to simulate a scenario, where scatterers are vibrating during the SAR imaging.
run "AzVib.m" to simulate a scenario, where scatterers are vibrating while a fixed MIMO radar is collecting signal with a fixed rate.
